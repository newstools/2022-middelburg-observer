An 11-month old baby girl was abandoned by her mother at Middelburg Provincial Hospital between Christmas and New Year. The mother has been traced by Middelburg Child Welfare, but ran away from the Middelburg Magistrates Court today, shortly ahead of a scheduled appearance. According to a social worker, Middelburg Child Welfare was notified of the abandonment on Monday, spurring court proceedings to place the infant in a place of safety. The mother was accompanied to court today, where she bailed on proceedings, leaving the court with no other choice but to remove the infant from her care indefinitely. The child is safe but in need of nappies, clothes and other baby necessities. The mother has not been found since her earlier disappearance at court today. Drug dependency may have played a role in the abandonment of the baby girl. The baby is healthy and being cared for. Size 4/5 nappies and baby clothes for infants 12 to 18 months, is needed. Baby formula and other necessities like toiletries are also needed. Residents who wish to contribute can phone 013 110 3742 or 072 333 7221.
