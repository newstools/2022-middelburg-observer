 A distraught Ms Adele Daught contacted www.mobserver.co.za at 17:00 to ask for help. The man was clothed in a white shirt and underpants. He could not speak and foam and blood was coming from his nose and mouth. She went to the security of the Middelburg Hospital, thinking that he might have escaped from one of the wards.
They told Ms Daught that he was actually discharged from hospital! The minute Ms Judy van Deventer (Leef Liefde organisation) heard about it, she rushed to De Villiers Street. “He is very ill. He is going to die if he stays on the street!” She could also not believe that he was discharged from hospital.
“He is vomiting blood and he is mentally ill.” Members from Noodroep Radiogroep Sector 3 acted immediately when they were contacted about the sick man.
They called the Middelburg Provincial Ambulance Services, but at 19:25 the ambulance was still not there. “He is dying next to the road and there is nothing we can do!” one of the traumatised sector members told www.mobserver.co.za
