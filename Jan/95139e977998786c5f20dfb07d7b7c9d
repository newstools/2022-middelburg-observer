Four people, including a child, lost their lives when two vehicles collided between the Hendrina and Samora Machel off-ramps on the N4 around 16:30 on Sunday. Both drivers of the vehicles, a light delivery vehicle and sedan, were rushed to Bethal Hospital, while the four passengers of the sedan was declared dead on the scene. According to MEC for Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Mr Vusi Shongwe, it appears that one of the drivers may have lost control of the vehicle due to wet weather before the collision. An investigation of the exact cause of the crash is underway. MEC Shongwe urged motorists to obey all road rules, and to be extra vigilant during wet road conditions. More rain has been predicated throughout the week.
