A second accident victim has come forward, owing his narrow escape from death to the potholes on the road. Marchell Posthumus was driving to work early morning on 5 January when the accident took place.
He had driven the same route a week earlier when it was in a much better state, and could never have foretold what awaited him.  The road surface was covered in mud and the potholes filled with rainwater when he struck one of them with his Volkswagen Golf. He lost control of his vehicle and rolled. Marchell says that he sustained soft tissue injury to his back, shoulder and head, but was fortunate to escape serious injury.
He however shared his concern for the safety of other motorists, after www.mobserver.co.za reported on a similar accident.  •Ms Andrie Botes described the accident her son was in as miraculous, when he and three colleagues escaped a wreckage with minor injuries after also striking a pothole on the N11.
