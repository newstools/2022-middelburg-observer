The woman asked not to be identified. It was initially reported that a Regina Jassian (7) a Zimbabwean national, was killed on Keiskamma Drive when a Toyota Fortuner overtook another vehicle and hit her at the Uitkyk informal settlement. The woman said that the accident occurred on the N4 highway and not on Keiskamma Drive, about 1km before the Van Dijksdrift offramp, and the Fortuner was travelling in the direction of eMalahleni. (Uitkyk is nestled between Keiskamma Drive and the N4 in the area where the accident occurred.) According to her, the Toyota, with minor children on board, was travelling within the speed limit and switched lanes from left to right to pass a truck when a child suddenly ran over the road. “They tried to swerve to avoid her, but it simply was not possible. She ran onto the highway straight in front of them,” the woman said. The people involved in the accident are still traumatized by events, but several eyewitness statements supports their version, the woman told www.mobserver.co.za.
