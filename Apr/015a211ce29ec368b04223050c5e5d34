“Apart from the fun day, we are also pledging a donation of R10 000 to the Middelburg Care Village to assist them with providing the best aid for the orphaned and destitute children under their care. We trust that our contribution will make positive difference in the lives of the kids,” says Bradley Bekker, Evotel’s Head of Brand.
