Thieves gained access to the home in Buller Street yesterday mid-morning, after Mariana van den Bergh, residing there, had left home for a short while. Upon her arrival, the front door stood wide open with no sign of forced entry and her room was ransacked. A strong scent of perfume also hang heavily in the air, suggesting that one of the perpetrators might have been a woman. The thieves made off with every last piece of her jewellery, including an heirloom and a limited edition Comrades Marathon silver medal that was issued to commemorate Pietermaritzburg’s 150th year of establishment. The medal had especially been adapted into a pendant by a jeweller. Apart from the jewellery, several cell phones and letters written by her children were also looted. The homeowners made a plea to the public, that should any jewellery or the rare medal be pawned, to please contact Tobie van den Bergh on 072 220 1568. A reward of R1000 is offered for the return of the medal.
