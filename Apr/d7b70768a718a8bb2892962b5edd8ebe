The criminals have been seen driving a white VW Polo TSI. Two women who asked for anonymity became victims of the criminal syndicate in March. One of the women said she was walking in Walter Sisulu Street heading to Shoprite when the white Polo parked next to her. Two men climbed out of the vehicle and attempted to kidnap her. The woman said she fought for her life and managed to run away, one of the men took her bag and made off with her cell phone and money. Another victim also said she was nearly kidnapped by the robbers while walking in Walter Sisulu Street.The criminals used the same modus operandi and made off with her cell phone and money. The robbers usually target hitchhikers in the CBD, on the old Witbank road and in Rockdale. Residents are urged to be cautious and to avoid hitchhiking.
