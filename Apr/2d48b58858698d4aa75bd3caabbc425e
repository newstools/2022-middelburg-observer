In response to the nervous alerts made by Waterfront residents, members of the DA Elsie Vermooten and Johann Dyason held an inspection of the dam wall yesterday, along with municipal officials. Cllr. Dyason told www.mobserver.co.za that two engineers will be assessing the wall today, to determine how to fix the leak. He explained that the leak is situated higher up on the wall, which suggests that the crack is not compromising the integrity of the structure. After yesterday’s inspection, they are not too concerned about a possible collapse, but the crack needs immediate attention to prevent the possibility. The roots of the Blue-gum trees growing nearby, are also responsible for damage to the dam wall, and the municipality will consider sawing them down depending on the engineers’ reports. Feedback based on the inspection that will be made by the engineers will be relayed at a later stage. “We are aware of the urgency of the situation and have reported it to the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, who will address the possible risks.”
