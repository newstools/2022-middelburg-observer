Concerned residents reported the leaking water that was running down Dr Beyers Naudé Drive behind the Witkerk’s property. The church office confirmed that the pipe burst has been reported and that the municipality is currently on the site repairing the leak. The Kanonkop and Dennesig suburbs have also struggled with intermittent water interruptions for the whole week while the municipality conducts the switchover from the old asbestos pipe network to the new PVC pipe system. A public notice issued by DA Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, on Tuesday, explained that the water had to be shut off at the reservoir due to valve failure. He further explained that reservoir levels are struggling to pick up due to high usage under residents, in particular over Freedom Day. Continuous pipe bursts also result in fire hydrants being opened to bleed out the system of air to prevent other bursts. Ultimately, these factors all prevent reservoir levels from rising, causing low water pressure and water interruptions in low-lying areas like Dennesig and Kanonkop. Community WhatsApp groups are circulating the addresses of residents who have availed their bore holes to neighbours in need. • Residents with access to water are urged to minimise water usage to allow reservoir levels to pick up.
