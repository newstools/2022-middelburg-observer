The EFF orchestrated the march on behalf of Hope City tenants who will be opening up cases of fraud and theft of rental deposits against the Steve Tshwete Housing Association. They are demonstrating against the Steve Tshwete Housing Association (STHA) for allegedly not providing service delivery and building maintenance, as well as constant electricity cuts due to non-payment by the STHA, illegal evictions, illegal towing of vehicles, and unlawful repossessing of furniture. Tenants want a trust fund to be set up for them to pay their rent into instead of the housing association’s account as the STHA doesn’t pay rates and services to the municipality, which results in residents being unable to purchase electricity.
