Residents were pleasantly surprised to see how maintenance was done over the weekend in the Kees Taljaard Stadium area where municipal workers, like fairies, repainted street markings, repaired the gaping hole in the fence at the cricket stadium, restored potholes, newly renovated the change rooms of the rugby club and even cleaned the streets with an industrial road sweeper. Those residents, however, pointed out that the sudden and miraculous intervention is owned to the upcoming visit of President Cyril Ramaphosa. One resident only known as “Oom Koos”, stated the following in a letter: Our President is a miracle worker. I suspect without him being aware of it. The area around the Kees Taljaard Stadium, where he is to address the nation on Freedom Day, experienced a metamorphosis the past few days. The roads were painted fresh, the dilapidated concrete walls repaired and to my utter dismay the sewerage leak from the stadium running into the Klein Olifants dried up… Overnight. That after three months at 432000 liter per 24 hour to Loskop dam. In vain was my preparations for a lively demonstration on Wednesday. I, with help from my garden man, even mastered the toi-toi art. Considered burning tires – but with the price of petrol nowadays! Just shows you what President Cyril Ramaphosa is capable of. May this beneficial effect of our President, like yeast, spread throughout our South African bread. We are in dire need of it.
