Eye witness accounts state that the accident took place after the light-motor vehicle involved, which was coming from the golf course’s direction allegedly skipped the red light to turn right into traffic. The Fortuner then struck it on the side.  The two occupants of the smaller vehicle were killed upon impact. A bystander, who had stopped at the scene moments after the accident, explained that the driver of the Fortuner was leaning against another car, in shock. She was taken to hospital by ambulance. Motorists are advised that traffic flowing along Walter Sisulu is being redirected down Hobson and Eeufees Street.
