Military convoys, as well as a jet cloaked in South African colours, were seen passing through town earlier today. Residents have been cautioned that the president’s visit will undoubtedly cause disruptions to traffic in the Kees Taljaard area.
Information was received that all roads running past the stadium’s area will either be closed or strictly monitored at checkpoints.  It is expected that both intersections of Lilian Ngoyi- and Protea Street, as well as Dr Beyers Naudé Drive, will be blocked off by checkpoints, delaying traffic.
All streets running between Protea- and Dr Beyers Naudé Drive will be closed to traffic. These traffic regulations will be implemented from 04:00 to 15:00 and motorists are advised to make use of alternative routes. Access to the Kees Taljaard Stadium is strictly based on pre-approval.
