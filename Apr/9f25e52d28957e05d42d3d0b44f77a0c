A resident, Kaymin van der Walt, called www.mobserver.co.za to inform that she had seen the monkey on the corner of Dr Beyers Naudé Drive and Oos Street earlier this morning. A photo is circulating on social media with reports that the monkey was seen on the roof of Hoërskool Middelburg. Marketing agent at MHS, Minicke Burger, told www.mobserver.co.za that she is aware of the photo, but hasn’t seen the monkey on school property. She is currently trying to confirm the origin of the photo.
