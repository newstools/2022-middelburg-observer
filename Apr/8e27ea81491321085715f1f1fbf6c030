Waterfront residents sounded the alarm of the leaking dam wall over the Easter weekend, airing their concerns of a possible collapse. Www.mobserver.co.za reported yesterday, about members of the DA who assessed the dam wall alongside a supervisor from the municipality’s Department of Water and Sanitation. During the visit, it was assured that engineers would inspect the crack in the dam wall urgently. Following the assessment, Da Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, explained that the crack in the dam wall was situated higher up, minimising concerns that the integrity of the structure was compromised. Cllr. Dyason, however, warned that the crack should be addressed immediately to prevent the collapse of the dam wall, which would have a devastating impact on surrounding areas. In a recent update given by Cllr. Dyason, it was said that despite promises from the municipal supervisor that immediate attention would be given to the cracking dam wall, nothing has been done since. In retaliation, the DA now intends on escalating their reports to the Manager of Roads and Storm Water Department, Lindiwe Sisolo. “To restore the dam wall, the Kruger Dam will have to be drained of some of its water. It is unclear whether the whole dam will be drained, and we certainly hope that would not be the case. Either way, the process will carry an enormous financial cost to the Municipality. The crack, however cannot be ignored and needs to be prioritised to prevent a possible disaster,” Cllr. Dyason concluded. • Should the dam wall collapse, large masses of water would flow down the ravine that runs through Mineralia, Middelburg South, Laerskool CR Swart area and Eastdene. The spring runs into the Vaalbank spring and connects to the Klein Olifants river just below the 4SAI Infantry Battalion.
