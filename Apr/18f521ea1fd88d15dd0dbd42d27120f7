Traffic was temporarily halted by the marching red berets, who made their way to the station to demand immediate action regarding the Hope City debacle. Hope City tenants have been caught in a lengthy dispute with the Steve Tshwete Housing Association (STHA) for not providing service delivery and building maintenance, constant electricity cuts due to non-payment by the STHA, illegal evictions, illegal towing of vehicles, and the unlawful repossessing of furniture. It is assumed that the EFF has marched to the station to demand that police assist the tenants in opening cases of theft and fraud. Reports circulating on social media state that threats of violence were made by the EFF, including threats of torching the station. No incidents of violence or violent behaviour have been received thus far, and the marchers were peaceful.
