Our beloved Antonov AN-2 aircraft is in desperate need of help. Little Annie is a charity aircraft sponsored from Russia to do charity work all over Africa. On June 25 a fundraising event will be hosted to help her get back in the air. On August 27 we will be celebrating Little Annie’s 10 year anniversary in South Africa with another big event. The fundraiser event will be taking place at the Middelburg airfield on June 25 and will be hosting the following artists: Dirk McLoud, Renier, Hermie Pienaar, Gerhard Supra and Armand Hofmeyr. Futher details containing the entrance fee and the program for the day will be announced in an updated post.
