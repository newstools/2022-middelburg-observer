According to a media release issued by the Provincial Commissioner’s Office, members of the Highway Patrol were on duty yesterday (Monday) when they noticed a suspicious VW Golf travelling in the opposite direction towards Pretoria. The officers made a U-turn and followed the vehicle, which was occupied by two male suspects. The suspects noticed they were being pursued and accelerated in an attempt to evade the officers. This resulted in the suspected vehicle swerving into oncoming traffic. The suspects then abandoned the vehicle and tried to flee on foot when a shootout ensued. The officers finally managed to apprehend one of the suspects while the other evaded arrest.
No injuries were sustained in the shootout. The officers arrested the shooter, who is an illegal immigrant from Mozambique. He was charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm with ammunition and contravention of the Immigration Act. The suspect is expected to appear in the Middelburg Magistrates’ Court soon facing the said charges. Police cannot rule out the possibility of adding more charges, as the firearm will be taken for ballistic testing to determine if it was used in a crime elsewhere. The vehicle was also seized and will form part of the investigation. A manhunt was also launched by the SAPS for the suspect who managed to escape.
