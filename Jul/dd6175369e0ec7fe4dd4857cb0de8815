The WhatsApp line that has recently been implemented will be replacing the municipal call centre. Residents who wish to report water or electricity interruptions can do so directly by sending a WhatsApp message, including your name, surname, address and a description of the problem to 064 915 3362. Residents who report service delivery failures are asked to notify their ward councillors to prevent the duplication of reports.
