According to Trac a number of trucks blocked the highway by dumping loads of coal on the road. It is unclear at this stage what led to the protest by coal truckers, but rising fuel prices has been mentioned as the reason. Trac is on the scene busy clearing the carriageway. Motorists should approach the area with caution.
