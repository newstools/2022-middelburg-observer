DA Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, explained that he is currently awaiting on feedback from the municipal electrical department on an estimated restoration time, which cannot be determined until the full extent of the damages, caused by the cable theft, has been made. “We are waiting to confirm where the cable theft took place and how much damage was caused, but from our understanding it seems quite extensive. Only once the extent of the damage was assessed will we be able to provide an estimated restoration time.” Feedback from VF+ Councillor, Juanita Mentz, also explained that an oil cable that feeds to the substation in Sipres- and Njala Street is reportedly leaking oil. The municipality did not have enough oil supply and needed to replenish the supply, which resulted in further delays. While the municipality is currently busy with repairs to the cable and replenishment of the oil supply, the cable will have to be replaced at a later stage. Cllr. Mentz further appealed to the public to report suspicious activities at substations and electricity boxes. “No contractors will ever force an electricity box open without the presence of an electrician. We therefore urge residents who witness any sort of tampering to contact municipal law enforcement on 013 249 7087.” • The cable theft comes on the back of incidents of vandalism that was reported in several streets in Kanonkop, yesterday.
Electricity boxes in Eland, Sering and Mimosa Street were broken open by vandals yesterday during load shedding. According to a resident, Bernard van der Berg, the vandals were startled by activity and the electricity boxes were broken open, but no significant damage was caused.
