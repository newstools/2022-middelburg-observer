One of the trucks is parked across the entire carriageway, blocking both sides of the road. Weather conditions are also extremely misty around the scene. No serious injuries have been reported. It’s unclear at this stage what caused the collision, and motorists should use alternative routes. Emergency services have already been dispatched, and witnesses say they are still waiting for traffic officers and SAPS to assist.
