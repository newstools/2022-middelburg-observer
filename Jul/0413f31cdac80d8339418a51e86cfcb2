A member of the organising committee, Monica Joao, confirmed the cancellation, which was owed to “technical issues” that could not be resolved in time. “The GTR2022 team would like to thank our sponsors for their support and understanding. If you have entered for the race online, then your money will be refunded back to you. If you have made payment via an EFT for a hospitality site or an entry, then the GTR admin team will be in contact with you,” Ms Joao said. For any further queries please email admin@gtr.co.za.
