Five security guards were arrested by police, after clashing with a rival security company contracted by the Mpumalanga Department of Health, at Middelburg Hospital yesterday. The squabble, during which four security guards were wounded by rubber bullets,, resulted in five men between the ages of 26 and 40 being charged for discharge of a firearm in a public space and assault with intent to cause harm. Only one guard was treated and later discharged. Police are also probing reports of a live round being fired during the  clash.  Its unclear what led to the assault. “The behaviour displayed at the hospital can never be tolerated. Members of the security cluster should be exemplary in conduct. We hope that the law will take its course,” said Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Daphney Manamela. The five suspects will make their first court appearance soon.
