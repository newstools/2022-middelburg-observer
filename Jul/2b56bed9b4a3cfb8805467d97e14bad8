According to the Mpumalanga SAPS, the children were in the care of their older 17-year-old brother at the time of the incident. Their 33-year-old mother, who is an undocumented Mozambican, reportedly left the children with their older brother for three days. Provincial Police Spokesperson, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said, “It is not yet confirmed what might be the cause of the fire, but loose cables were visible on the ground, which prompts suspicion that there may have been an illegal connection of electricity.” The brother attempted to rescue his siblings, however, the blaze was too unbearable. The children’s mother and the older brother were transported to the hospital for shock.
