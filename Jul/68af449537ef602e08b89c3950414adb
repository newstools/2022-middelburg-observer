The suspects, who cannot be formally identified because they haven’t appeared in court yet, are expected to make their first court appearance today (Monday) in the Belfast Magistrates’ Court. On June 24, the Nelspruit Serious Organised Crime Unit, SAPS Flying Squad, and the departments of labour and home affairs, arrested Carlos Bernardo Guambe and Gabriele Bernardo Guambe on allegations of human trafficking. All four suspects are accused of trafficking 39 people, including children under the age of five. According to information, the victims were brought into South Africa in a taxi from Mozambique and taken to a farm in Belfast, where they were subjected to forced labour.
