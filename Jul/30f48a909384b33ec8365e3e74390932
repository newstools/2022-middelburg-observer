The bullet in his neck is the Yikas signature on his soul. His wife of 40 years met an early grave at the Yikas’ hands. Robert was spared.
The question of why, haunting the remainder of his days, alone, without Sue Howarth. Survivor guilt is just another wound etched onto Robert Lynn, like the blowtorch burns he was left with.
Today, the Yikas are in jail serving a 20-year sentence for the barbaric 2016 Marchlands farm attack. They will one day be free from prison, while Robert is stuck with a lifelong sentence of perpetual sadness and fear. “I had always been fair to people with never a bad word or deed to anyone. Due to the trauma of the attack, I had to pack up my whole life and leave the country, as I did not feel safe anymore,” Mr Lynn says. “I was woken from my bed, shot in the neck and tortured for money.” He says, “Losing Sue in such a horrific way has impacted me to my core, I will never be at peace again.” He begged the court to sentence the Yikas to life imprisonment, but they received 20 years each for the murder. “They have shown themselves to be career criminals, crimes escalating with each event, now I will spend the rest of my life in my own prison with no chance of parole,” Mr Lynn says. According to Mr Lynn, the mental anguish of being “the survivor” has been etched indelibly onto his soul “like the bullet I carry in my neck”. He says he’s had to carry on with trauma counselling at his own expense “to avoid the embarrassment of registering as a mental health dependent with the UK’s national health service”. Mr Lynn says his feelings of guilt have eroded all faith in the human race. “I feel the Yikas should have been sentenced in another world, where the death sentence is mandatory, a life for a life…”
