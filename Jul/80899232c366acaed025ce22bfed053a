Police fired several shots at protestors in the area yesterday, where they blocked the Emgwenya tunnel at Waterval Boven. TLBs have been deployed by Trac to clear the road surface of debris, and the road remain closed until further notice. Apart from the road closure at the tunnel, traffic delays can also be expected at Karino/Mabalel, due to a vehicle collision. There’s also a stationary truck at Matsulu, leading to Komatipoort.
