Large parts of Kanonkop as well as Dennesig experienced water interruptions since yesterday due to the planned maintenance. Parts of Dennesig have also been affected due to failure of cut-off valves leading to the suburb, which needed to undergo repair. “The Department of Water and Sanitation worked throughout the night on Kanonkop’s water reticulation system as well as to replace the faulty valves. Repairs have been complete and the teams are now assessing the areas without water. We understand the frustration experienced by residents, but kindly ask for their patience as water supply will hopefully be restored soon to affected areas.”
