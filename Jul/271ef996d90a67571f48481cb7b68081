The children were left burnt beyond recognition last week after the shack they were sleeping in caught fire when electricity returned after load-shedding.
The children, aged eight and 15 years old, were with their older brother when the fire broke out. Their mother, who was reportedly not at home at the time of the incident, was transported to the Middelburg Provincial Hospital for shock, and the older brother was also admitted.
