A resident of the area says that the hive is located on the sidewalk on municipal property, and is known about by most residents, including children. The woman, wishing to remain anonymous, raised the alarm after yesterday’s incident, out of concern for everybody’s safety, saying that she has been stung a few times before and that both her husband and son have a bee allergy. The resident said that she watched how another woman walked past the hive moments after children who live in flats nearby, aggravated the bees by throwing rocks at them. She does not know how severely the woman was stung because the woman ran down the street in an attempt to get away. The attack follows closely on another incident, where a 3 year-old girl was admitted into hospital after being stung 54 times on the Sunbeams Nursery School premises. Www.mobserver.co.za alerted local beekeeper, Martin Nel, about the hive. Mr Nel, after learning of the incident, strongly warned residents to avoid aggravating bees. He pointed out that the children who threw the rocks were responsible for the attack on the woman. Mr Nel said that he would go and remove the hive the minute he has chance. “Beekeepers only tend to hives early evenings once it has cooled down because that is when bees are calmest. There is very little to be done to an angry nest by day. We do spray them to calm them down, but using smoke or poison won’t help get rid of it. There is also very little to be done once bees attack someone when they’re angry. That is why the best method is to avoid the nest altogether and rather appoint the help of an expert to remove the hive.”
