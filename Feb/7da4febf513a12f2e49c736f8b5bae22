According to municipal spokeswoman Prudence Magutle, management is currently meeting with Mayor Mhlonishwa Masilela, who will address striking employees shortly. Ms Magutle said she will be providing www.mobserver.co.za with a full update on the decisions reached over the next few hours. “No decision has been taken yet, but I can say that Mayor Masilela is siding with the residents of Middelburg on this unfortunate turn of events.” Municipal employees are refusing the public entry to the municipal buildings, where they gathered last night in the municipal parking lot, dispersing at around 22:00. Employees also remain hell-bent on forcing the municipality to upgrade them from a Level 4 salary grade to a Level 5. “We have one priority, and that is getting employees back to work,” Ms Magutle said. The ANC’s regional management were locked in meetings with role players, including Advocate Khenisa, the whole of yesterday. Political pressure is mounting on municipal management to find a permanent solution to the labour dispute. Advocate Khenisa says he will abide by any decision, but will not compromise on his principles by bowing to political pressure or the workers’ demands. The current situation is overshadowing the municipality’s cleanest audit in years under the leadership of Advocate Khenisa.
