Bongani Ginindza, Thandiwe Sibanyoni, Prudence Mabena Zulu and Gugu Mathibela, were granted bail of R1 000 and warned not to participate in the current municipal strike and any form of public violence until their case is finalised. The matter was postponed to March 30 for further investigation. The magistrate gave the accused a tongue lashing and urged them not to destroy infrastructure. The gallery was filled with municipal workers supporting the accused. The four were part of the group of workers who were believed to be barring the public and other municipal employees reporting for duty, and from accessing the municipality. The employees were warned to leave the premises, however, they did not do so hence the Middelburg Police made the arrest.
