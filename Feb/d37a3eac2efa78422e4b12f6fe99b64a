The various pipe bursts all over town and power interruptions have been reported and will be tended to as soon as possible. Residents are also informed that the block on purchase of electricity has been temporarily lifted until Saturday. Cllr. Hennie Niemann clarified that residents who owe money can purchase electricity but that their outstanding amounts will have to be paid at some point. “If an outlet says that your arrears does not reflect on your account, do not think that the debt is scratched off. Save whatever money you have set aside for the arrears as it will have to be paid at a later stage.” Waste collection will not be taking place either and there is no indication of how long the strike will last. •Residents have met at the Civic Centre today at 11:00 where a memorandum was handed over to the Executive Mayor.
