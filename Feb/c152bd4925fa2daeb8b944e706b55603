Concerned residents reported multiple leaks in Dr Beyers Naudé, as well as OR Tambo Street. Upon www.mobserver.co.za‘s arrival in Dr Beyers Naudé Street, it was noticed that the leak is gushing an enormous amount of water, which is now flowing like a stream into OR Tambo, well past the correctional centre. The leaks were instantly reported to Media Spokesperson for the Steve Tshwete Municipality, Prudence Magutle, who in turn reported it to the Executive Director of Infrastructure.  The municipal management is currently in a meeting to try and resolve the resurfaced municipal strike, which has brought a standstill to all services. While Ms Magutle took note of the severity of the leak, she could not provide an estimated restoration time. The pipe in Dr Beyers Naudé Street is being fed by the Kruger Dam Water Works, which purifies water from Athlone Dam. Residents are advised that the leak will affect water pressure in the CBD area.
