Last year residents went days without water due to an ongoing municipal strike. Today, some areas including the CBD and surrounds, including the Amora Animal Park, have been without water for between three and four days. The park is in a predicament because the animals need water and there’s also a restaurant and doggy parlour whose businesses are adversely affected. The municipality has availed a fire engine and other water tankers to supply residents with water for household use. The water is not potable and should not be used as drinking water. Water pressure has also started dissipating in areas like Kanonkop and the municipality is urging residents to use water sparingly. The municipality is investigating the cause of the problem. The water outage is affecting particularly areas between Lilian Ngoyi and Wes streets. Water tanks are making the rounds in the area and are currently stationed at the animal park and in Wes Street. The municipality has already inspected valves and the main waterline but cannot say what the problem is at this stage. The authority has apologised for the inconvenience.
