In light of the recent statement, Adv. Bheki Khenisa confirmed to www.mobserver.co.za that he has not yet formally tendered his resignation, but that he plans to do so in the near future. Adv. Khenisa’s plan on resignation follows shortly on a recent meeting between opposition parties and striking municipal workers. The DA directed an open letter to Adv. Khenisa, asking him to resign voluntarily, as council believed that the civil working relationship between him and the municipal strikers was irreparable. During the last meeting, municipal employees said that they were satisfied with the bench-marking process of the municipality. Their ultimate demand was for Adv. Khenisa “to go”.
