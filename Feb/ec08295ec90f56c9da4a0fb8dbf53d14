Capt. Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson, said that Themba Titos Sibeko (39) and France Josia Moiane (24), were arrested on February 10. On February 9, two men bought fuel and presented a bank card as payment. It later turned out that the card was counterfeit. The following day, a bank investigator visited the premises to follow up on a fraudulent transaction that was reported to have happened the day before. One of the employees at the filling station recognised Sibeko and Moiane when they arrived for a second time, travelling in the same vehicle they drove the previous day, whilst the investigator was still present. Authorities were informed and the suspects were arrested on the spot. Sibeko and Moiane have been charged with fraud, theft, possessing and presenting counterfeit cards and contravening the Cybercrime Act. The duo appeared in the Middelburg Magistrates’ Court, where they were remanded in custody until their next appearance this Friday, and their residential addresses can be confirmed.
