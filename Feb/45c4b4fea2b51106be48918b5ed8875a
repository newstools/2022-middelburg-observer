Sunday Cornelius Ugweuezea (40) was arrested in Hendrina in 2017, but failed to return to court after he was released on bail in the Hendrina Magistrate’s Court. The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime unit in Secunda, assisted by Witbank Crime Intelligence, traced Ugweuezea to his hiding place in Klip Street, Middelburg, where he was arrested. Ugweuezea was remanded in custody in Hendrina until February 9 when he will formally apply for bail.
