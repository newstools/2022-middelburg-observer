The municipality issued a notice informing residents of the authority’s internet connections are down. Online services are, however, available to access account statements and to make payments. Independent electricity vendors have also not been affected. A restoration time could not be provided. The municipality will inform residents on municipal social media platforms when connections have been restored. The problem will also affect all incoming and outbound e-mails.
