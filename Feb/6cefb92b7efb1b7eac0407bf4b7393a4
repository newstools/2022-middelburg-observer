The learners haven’t been to class since January 27. On Tuesday, chaos erupted again at the embattled school when four learners were reportedly assaulted by a teacher defending the school principal, Ms Dudizile Lusenga. The learners told www.mobserver.co.za that the principal was escorted by the Middelburg Police into her office to get documents. As she was leaving the building, learners confronted her, asking her why she was present on school premises? Learners and parents have staged numerous demonstrations in an attempt to have the principal removed from her post, after accusing her of mismanaging school funds, stealing laptops, and insulting parents, teachers and learners. Last year in April, the then school governing body (SGB) was dissolved, and the principal was asked to step down. A court order ruling instructed Ms Lusenga to resume her duties in January. Since the court ruling, the principal has been attempting to resume her duties, but her return to the school has been met with hostility, and the school has remained closed. On Wednesday morning, the learners, accompanied by parents and politicians, went to the Middelburg Hawks office to open an assault case against the teacher. The parents said the Middelburg Police refused to open a case and they went to the Hawks to ask them to intervene. • On Monday, the principal received a court interdict against 22 teachers, past SGB members, and parents. She also applied for a protection order. The case will go to court on April 14. • Numerous attempts have been made to reach the Mpumalanga Department of Education, no comment could be reached before print.
