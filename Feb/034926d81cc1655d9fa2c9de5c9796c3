Police appealed to the owner of the wheelie bin to report the bin stolen so that formal charges could be brought against the suspect. The man and an accomplice were found pushing the bin down Morkel Street around 08:00 on Tuesday. When the suspects where approached by radio group members of Sector 3, one of them succeeded in fleeing while the other was detained. Expensive electrical equipment and cables were found inside the bin after which the suspect was arrested by police. Police appealed to the public to identify the owner of the bin by providing the bin’s serial number. It has since been discovered that the bin is registered to a vacant home. The home’s last owner could, however, not been traced by available information on the municipality’s accounts database. Its also clear that the suspected stolen property, was not stolen at the vacant Morkel Street address. Police warned that the suspect could not be detained if a crime was not reported.
