Mr Arthur Hill decided to establish the forum to allow unity under residents who have all been gravely affected by the strike and are desperate for intervention. He has called on residents to join the first meeting next week Wednesday, at 17:30 on Kees Taljaard Stadium’s A field. The purpose of the meeting is to encourage a peaceful and civil approach towards finding a solution for the illegal strike and its lasting effects. Everybody is welcome to attend and share their inputs as long as it remains constructive and helpful towards the group’s objective.
