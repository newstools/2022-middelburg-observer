According to a source, employees feel “targeted, mistreated and demoralized”. Earlier today, employees dispersed to the Nkangala District Municipality where they called on the district to intervene in the ongoing labour dispute. They have, however, returned to the civic centre where they await dialogue with Mayor Masilela. Mayor Masilela visited Mr Makwati’s home situated in the mayor’s constituency Ward 21, shortly after 07:00 this morning upon learning of the attack. He condemned the attack and urged police to arrest those responsible. Advocate Khenisa also strongly condemned the attempt on Mr Makwati’s life. The municipality said it would update the community on service interruptions after further discussions with the workers.
