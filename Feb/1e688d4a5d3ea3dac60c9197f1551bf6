The incident took place at 21:30 last night, on the corner of Cowen Ntuli- and Wes Street. The three vehicles belonging to municipal officials and contractors had their tyres slashed and windows thrown out. Shots were also fired during the incident.  Executive Mayor Mshlonishwa Masilela attended the scene. Councillors explained that two of the three vehicles were privately owned and are not insured. The councillors expressed their gratitude to the individuals who risked their lives to help restore services to the public. They also called on residents for assistance in replacing the slashed tyres on the privately-owned vehicles.  Should anyone be willing to donate towards the replacement of the tyres, they can contact the Middelburg Observer’s editorial office.
