The meeting was called after four striking employees were arrested at the civic centre around 23:00 last night. A total of 11 vehicles were also impounded by the police. Scores of agitated strikers gathered at the civic centre again this morning and all municipal services have been fully suspended. Office employees were also ordered to stay home after some councillor’s vehicles were damaged by striking employees yesterday. Councillors could still enter the municipality yesterday but today all gates have been barred by striking employees. Police responded to chaotic scenes at the civic centre last night after at least fifteen gunshots were fired. There were also reports that a number of houses and vehicles of municipal employees were damaged in Mhluzi last night. Provincial police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdluli, said he was unable to comment as investigations are unfolding. He could also not confirm the attacks carried out in Mhluzi during the night. The situation has become extremely volatile after last night’s arrests.
