Motorists are urged to be cautious when travelling to Arnot as protesters have blockaded the Arnot road on the bridge when turning off from the N4, as well as the first turn off from Hendrina’s direction. VF+ Ward Councillor, Mr Corrie Wolmerans, said that normal light-weight vehicles were let through the blockades earlier this morning but all heavy motor vehicles were cut off. Trucks and fuel tankers were used to block off the two routes.
