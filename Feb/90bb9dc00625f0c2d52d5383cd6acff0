Mr Ian Strydom, contacted www.mobserver.co.za in frustration, and reported that this is the second incident in four months. The theft took place last night, after a main underground cable leading to a transformer located on the sidewalk, was cut off and stripped for its copper. The thieves had cut the cable in multiple locations and also broke open the transformer to steal cables inside. A local electrician, At Botha, pointed out that at least R3000’s damage was inflicted on one cable alone and how the thieves stripped the cable on site over night after finding casings scattered around the scene. •Mr Strydom highlighted that this incident follows on another which took place in November last year, after the dealership’s generator, which is roughly worth R300 000, was possibly sabotaged. He further mentioned that there is very little to be done to secure the targeted area because it is located on the sidewalk of Boncker Street, but concluded that the dealership will have to tighten up on security measures to prevent any more incidents. “Scrap metal dealers who buy stolen copper off of these thieves are contributing heavily towards this problem,” Mr Strydom added. Mr Strydom assured that the dealership is open for business regardless of the theft.
