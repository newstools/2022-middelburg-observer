Supply to the above areas were restored early Sunday morning. SADC Street and surrounds, however, continued to have challenges with water supply into Sunday evening. The pipe burst was only discovered on Saturday by municipal teams who worked tirelessly to pinpoint the fault. They worked throughout Saturday night to restore supply, after the municipality dispatched a number of water tankers to the CBD, including Amora Animal Park, where animals were without water for some time. Local residents rushed to the park’s aid with water donations for the animals. The burst pipe In Ngwako Street was deep underground and millions of litres of water had been lost before the discovery of the burst. The town’s water woes is set to continue due to an outdated asbestos network, currently being replaced by PVC lines. Cowen Ntuli Street and surrounds were also affected by another water shortage on Saturday, after plumbers damaged an electrical cable on Saturday, affecting already depleted reservoir levels.
