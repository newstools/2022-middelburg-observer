The Middelburg Marathon Club Valentines Charity Race definitely caught the worm judging by the large number of early bird participants who gathered at Middelburg Mall for the 6 o’clock start this morning.  The 21km athletes are still on the road while 10km participants are starting to finish. There was also a 5km fun-run.  The race is hosted annually in partnership with the Rotary Club.
