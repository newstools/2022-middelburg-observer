A source within the tow truck industry said that most accidents occurred because of drunken or reckless and negligent driving, made worse by rainy weather experienced over the said weekend. Solange Soares, spokesperson for TRAC N4, said that six accidents occurred on the highway near Middelburg. A source claimed that one of the main reasons for the accidents was rainy weather, with speeding and reckless driving also suspected to play a role. When asked about the causes for the N4 accidents, Ms Soares referred us to the police accident reports for official data. The provincial police office said it does not release statistical information other than the quarterly crime statistics through the office of the Minister of Police. Regular accidents are handled by the Minister of Transport’s office, whilst only ‘driving under the influence of liquor or drugs’ are listed on police statistics. In one fatal crash on February 1, four people were killed after a minibus taxi rear-ended a truck near the Middelburg Plaza.
