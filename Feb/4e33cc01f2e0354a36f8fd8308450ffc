The bin contained thousands of rand worth of possibly stolen goods. The problem is, police cannot keep the suspect in custody if the owner of the bin does not report the bin stolen. Www.mobserver.co.za is also aware of the contents of the bin, but was asked not to identify the items, so that a blind-identification process of the items can be followed. Two men were actually found pushing the bin down Morkel Street, but only one was apprehended after the second succeeded in fleeing on foot. Police cannot say whether the contents in the bin belong to the owner of the bin. The municipality has also not digitized its bin distribution database, and say it can take days, even weeks, to identify the owner of the bin by manually sifting through the paper trail. If police cannot locate the owner, the suspect will be released. The police is urging green wheelie bin owners who’ve lost their bins to report it. The bin number is – 190620874.
