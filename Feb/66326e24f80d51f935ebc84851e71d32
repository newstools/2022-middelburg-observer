The Southern Ground Hornbill is a spectacular species that faces extinction due to destruction of habitat and secondary lead poisoning. With the odds stacked against them, the Baobab Breeding Project based on the Loskop Nature Reserve, continues their fight to protect the Southern Ground Hornbills and have already successfully reared four chicks this season, which will be released back into the wild. The Baobab Breeding Project calls on the community to help them celebrate Ground Hornbills by taking part in their awareness campaign.
