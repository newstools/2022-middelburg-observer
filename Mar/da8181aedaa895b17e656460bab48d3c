An eyewitness told www.mobserver.co.za that the SRC member was defending a female student who was allegedly assaulted by a police officer. The eyewitness said a group of students were picketing outside the Brug Street campus when a police officer started assaulting students. The SRC member allegedly intervened and was arrested and charged with public violence. When the female student, who was reportedly assaulted by the police officer, went to report the incident at the police station, she was reportedly detained and released in the evening. Video footage provided by the students shows a police officer confronting a student before picking up a stick and confronting a female student who is later seen falling to the ground. The students marched from their campus to the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court this morning. •The students staged a demonstration on Monday. SRC member Mburu Mburu Majijima said the students want all skills workshops to be accredited, the library to be refurbished, and the shortage of lecturers be addressed.
