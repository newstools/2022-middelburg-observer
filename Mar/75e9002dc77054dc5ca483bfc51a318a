Charnel Hattingh, Head of Marketing & Communications at Fidelity ADT, says “we have noticed that residents are not taking the bins back inside once rubbish has been collected, leaving their wheelie bins out overnight. “Residents are leaving their bins out overnight and criminals are using this as a ladder to climb over your perimeter wall, not only that but bins are also being stolen,” she says. She adds that the bins are being bumped over blocking driveways, which means residents must get out of their cars in the morning to move the bins exposing them to potential hijackings in the early hours. “Dustbins also provide a good hiding place for hijackers who may target residents returning from work in the evenings.” She urges residents to not only put their dustbins out on the morning of collection day but also remember to bring them back in. “If you are not going to return home at the end of a collection day, ask a neighbour to take your dustbin in. A dustbin left standing on the pavement is a dead give-a-way that there is nobody home. Remember to never put anything in your dustbin that has all your details on it. Always shred confidential information.” “Let’s work together to make our suburbs safer,” concludes Hattingh.
