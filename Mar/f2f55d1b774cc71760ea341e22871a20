According to a press release, Sfiso Johannes Khumalo who was previously sought for fraudulent transactions in the application of RDP houses in Rockdale and rearrested on 01 March 2021 by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Mpumalanga, was released on R10 000 bail on 30 March 2021. He allegedly appeared before court several times before later evading a court hearing. It is alleged that in October 2018, Sylvia Nyandeni (43) an employee of the Steve Tshwete Municipality allegedly colluded with Khumalo to defraud applicants of RDP houses in Middelburg. Nyandeni misrepresented herself as having the authority to receive money from the destitute applicants. The defrauded victims were given a bank account of Khumalo to deposit the funds which amounted to just over R700 000. The pair reportedly shared the proceeds afterwards. Nyandeni and Khumalo were summoned to appear before the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court on 24 July 2020, however only Nyandeni managed to honour the court appearance whilst Khumalo sent a sick note stating that he was not feeling well. The court ordered that Khumalo to appear alongside Nyandeni on the follow-up date which was scheduled for 20 August 2020, but he once again absconded. A new warrant of arrest was then issued. His co accused, Sylvia Nyandeni (43) appeared in court on 23 March 2022. The case was postponed to 4 May 2022. The Provincial Head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga, Major General Zodwa Mokoena is requesting the assistance of the public in locating the accused.
