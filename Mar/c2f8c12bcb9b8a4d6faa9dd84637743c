Middelburg’s youth have very little entertainment as it is in Middelburg which makes it even more disheartening to know that our residents can’t respect what is available to our community. The cricket field at Kees Taljaard was tore up by a motorist who must have gained access to the club premises through an unlocked gate.  Members of the Middelburg Cricket Club shared their dismay, after several people attested to maintaining the municipal facility at their own expense. These sportsmen and women frequently dock up the necessary funds to mow the lawn and preserve the pitch. The culprit who gained access to the property and drove deep furrows into the greens has not yet been caught.
