Tshepo Masha (32) and his mother Lina Masha appeared before the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday. The duo were arrested early this week, following the discovery of Mr Nkabinde’s decomposing body. Mr Masha is facing charges of murder while his mother is facing charges of defeating the ends of justice and perjury. Mr Nkabinde and Mr Masha were reported missing in February. It was later discovered that Mr Masha’s mother allegedly lied about her son being missing to mislead the police. The police managed to track Mr Nkabinde’s vehicle in Pretoria. This aided the police to arrest the mother and son. Mr Nkabinde was killed and buried in his home in Vuka Section, Mhluzi. The motive of the cold-hearted murder is unknown. The police exhumed the body on Thursday. On Friday (today) the distressed family of Mr Nkabinde gathered in the court gallery and emotionally cried during the hearing. Lina Masha also requested to be taken to the doctor after alleging that she was assaulted by the police. The two are remanded in custody and their case was postponed until 5 April for formal bail application.
