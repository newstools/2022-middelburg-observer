The Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, further lambasted on the suspects who target elderly people at their places of residence thereby robbing them of their personal items. “It is shameful to hear that our senior citizens are now being targeted by heartless criminals who show no mercy at all. On Sunday we had an incident of this nature where an old male pensioner was strangled to death in Delmas. This cannot be allowed to continue unabated. The person who committed this evil act against one of the country’s assets must be swiftly hunted down and be brought to book” said the General.
