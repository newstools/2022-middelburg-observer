Trac N4 issued a recent traffic alert that the section of the N4 between Belfast and Mbombela, which was closed after a collision involving a truck carrying explosives, has reopened. Motorists are advised that only the eastbound lane has been opened for traffic. Lanes bound for Gauteng remain closed and motorists heading in that way need to make use of alternative routes.
