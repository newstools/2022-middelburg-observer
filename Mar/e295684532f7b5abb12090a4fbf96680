On an audio making the rounds, worker representative Kgosi Makwati stated on air that striking workers will not return to work until April 1, when the MM’s tenure draws to a close. He further stated that workers cannot return to work as long as the MM remains employed and is actively serving in administration. Residents are advised that waste collection, amongst other services will not be taking place as scheduled. During a council meeting earlier today with Executive Mayor Mshlonishwa Masilela, workers were urged to return to work if they expect to receive salaries for the month of February. It was further stated that salaries for March will be curbed should strikers continue.
