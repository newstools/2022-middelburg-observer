A group of students, led by Student Representative Council (SRC) members, disrupted classes and lecturers were told to stop lessons. SRC member Mburu Mburu Majijima said the students want all skills workshops to be accredited, the library be refurbished, and the shortage of lecturers be addressed. The students sang and picketed outside both campuses. The police were dispatched and it is not clear when the strike will come to an end.
