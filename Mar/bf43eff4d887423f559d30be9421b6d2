Residents alerted www.mobserver.co.za of the lockdown at the civic centre earlier this morning, saying that services have once again been suspended. A reliable source from within the municipality confirmed that some people are trapped in the municipal buildings, where all access and power supply has been cut off. The source suggested that the lockdown is being driven by municipal employees who remain disgruntled over the recent benchmarking process of salaries. The Steve Tshwete Municipality’s communication office could not yet confirm the lockdown or a possible flare up of strike action. Residents are however urged to avoid the municipality until further notice.
