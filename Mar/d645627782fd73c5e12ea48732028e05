According to a media statement issued by the police, Fortune Nzima (32), Tebogo Moshia (28) and Bonny Motsepe (28) were apprehended by the SAPS on 18 March after they allegedly hijacked a truck on the N11. The statement made by the truck driver specified that he had stopped by a filling station on the N11 at roughly 19:30 to visit the convenience store when he was followed by three men. Two of the suspects then threatened the driver and his two passengers at gunpoint where they were tied with cables and forced into the back of the truck. The hijackers then proceeded to drive the truck between Cowen Ntuli and Mandela Drive when one of the suspects received a call notifying them that the police were behind them. The suspects then abandoned the truck before fleeing on foot into nearby bushes where members of the police managed to apprehend them. A case of truck hijacking was opened at the Middelburg Police Station and an investigation was launched into finding the other firearm that went missing. The three suspects appeared before the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday and are remanded in custody until March 29 for a formal bail application.
