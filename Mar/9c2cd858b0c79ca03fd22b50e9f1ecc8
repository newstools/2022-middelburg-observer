Care Village started an initiative to repair potholes and clean up the town. The operational manager, Rehandre Landman said the initiative is aimed at showing the community that ‘Care Village Cares in Action’, about the town. The project is spearheaded by Mr Landman, Care Village staff members and the children.  On Tuesday, the dedicated team repaired potholes in Walter Sisulu Street with the help of five staff members and six children. Mr Landman said the organisation received a donation of tar from a generous resident. The initiative is not only aimed at repairing potholes if the need arises Care Villages will also assist with cutting grass and collecting waste.
