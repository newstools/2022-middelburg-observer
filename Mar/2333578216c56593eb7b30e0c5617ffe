The crowd has blocked off the entrance to the Civic Centre and municipal trucks, including garbage trucks are lining Wanderers Street. According to the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality’s communication office, the municipal employees are not striking. The crowd gathered there to hold a meeting with their unions which was scheduled for 07:00 and they are expected to resume their duties by 07:30. Upon www.mobserver.co.za’s arrival, one man outside the municipality’s premises aggressively attacked the journalist’s vehicle. The licensing department appears to be open for services. While access to the Civic Centre is cut off, it is assumed that services will still be rendered during the course of the day.
