Most recent information that was reliably received suggests that apart from offices at the civic centre, other services have resumed and waste collection is actively taking place in scheduled areas around town.  A possible flare up of strike action was expected earlier this morning after the municipal building on Wanderers Street was locked down by employees who blocked off all entrances and exits and power supply to the building was cut off. People confirmed to having been “locked in” as well. Recent imagery obtained by www.mobserver.co.za shows that the municipality is still surrounded by vehicles and lingering gatherers. The scene, however remains calm.  Traffic was also interrupted earlier today after a garbage truck was parked across the Protea- and Walter Sisulu intersection. The interference was believed to have been a meeting at the magasyn between employees. According to the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality’s communication office, an official statement cannot be made until the outcome of this morning’s meeting is known.
