On Tuesday, Afri-Guard Security found suspects stealing aluminium from the Eskom power line that distributes electricity. The suspects took advantage during the time Eskom was busy servicing the lines and switched off the transmission to prevent injuries to passers-by. The Hawks from the national and provincial office were summoned to the crime scene together with other stakeholders. During the search aluminium was found loaded inside three trucks valued at R2.1 million. The suspects were arrested, charged and detained pending their first court appearance at the Emalahleni Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday (today).
