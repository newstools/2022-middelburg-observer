The gruesome discovery was made by passers-by. The forensic pathology department was dispatched to the scene. The mother’s identity is unknown. Pregnant women who don’t want to keep their unwanted babies are urged not to have illegal abortions. Instead of discarding the foetus, hand the baby over at the Precious Life Saver at St John’s Presbyterian Church at 57 Bhimy Damane Street, where the identity of the mother will be kept anonymous.
