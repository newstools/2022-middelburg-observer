The former employee of the events company was accosted earlier this morning on the business property and will soon be handed over to the police with possible charges of burglary with aggravating circumstances. Staff members explained on the scene that the suspect was employed part time. He frequently complained about the workload and his probation period was terminated. After his dismissal, the man allegedly planned to attack the store in seek of revenge. Another full-time employee caught wind of his plans and alerted the store owner. They said that the attack was premeditated and the suspect went as far as to unplug the store’s alarm yesterday. After observing that the alarm was reconnected, the alarm’s antennae was unscrewed to prevent it from transmitting an alarm signal to the Mid Alarms control room. The special operations unit were expecting the attack, and rushed to the property this morning where a suspect was apprehended in the store. He was in possession of rope, a pair of scissors, a bolt cutter and a pair of pliers. A member of the special operations unit, Shane van Rooyen, told www.mobserver.co.za that the suspect confessed to planning on hiding in the store until the opportune moment, and then attack staff members with the intention to rob the store. The suspect was restrained and is currently being held on the premises until the police arrive. Due to a shortage of vehicles, the SAPS has not yet responded to the scene. The suspect cannot be identified until he has been charged and has made a formal appearance in court.
