A sand spill is covering both lanes descending the pass in Groblersdal’s direction and can be extremely hazardous to drive through at high speeds. According to a motorist, two vehicles are on site where the arrestor beds are being leveled out, but no attention is being given to the sand spill. The thick sand is located on the last bends of the pass, beyond the last arrestor bed. It remains unclear when the sand spill took place. •One man was killed in a multi-vehicle collision yesterday afternoon which included a truck carrying bricks.
