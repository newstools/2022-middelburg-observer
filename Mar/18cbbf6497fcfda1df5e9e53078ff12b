Mayor Masilela said Adv. Khenisa will be serving his 30-day notice period to ensure a smooth handover at the end of the month. In the meantime, the illegally striking workers were urged to resume their duties immediately in order to receive their February salaries. Mayor Masilela said the workers’ salaries will be curbed in March due to the municipality’s ‘no work, no pay’ policy. He thanked Adv. Khenisa for doing a great job in ensuring the municipality received a clean audit, and for the economic boost the municipality has received under his tenure. Workers have been on strike for three weeks. During meetings, workers said they were happy with the benchmarking process of the municipality, however, they demanded that the municipal manager must resign. The Executive Director of Community Services, Ms Thokozile Zulu, will be acting as the municipal manager as of April 1, for three months, or until a new municipal manager is appointed.
