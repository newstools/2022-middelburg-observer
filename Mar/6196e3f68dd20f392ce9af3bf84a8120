According to the voice note in a female voice, all filling stations will be closed on Friday, with the boycott said to possibly continue into Saturday and Sunday. The unidentified woman says her own garage where she fills up confirmed the shutdown. She added that her “hubby’s company” had also been warned of the shortage due to garage closures. “Fill up,” the woman suggests. Local garages, however, called the voice note “fake”. Fresh Stop Caltex in Walter Sisulu Street said they received no correspondence from petrol and diesel suppliers about any supply shortages. The filling station also confirmed that they would be open for service throughout the weekend. Alzu Petroport on the N4 also confirmed “we’re definitely open and have ample supplies”. Shell Ultra City also confirmed that they will be open for business denying any shortages alongside Engen Waterfront and Engen Maranata.
