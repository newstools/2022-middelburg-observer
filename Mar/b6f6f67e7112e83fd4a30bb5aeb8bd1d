Frustrated residents have been in queues since 06:00 waiting to receive service from the traffic department. The ratepayers were told that the municipal officials are in a “meeting” however they were not told what time they would resume their duties. Workers are reportedly deadlocked in a meeting since 08:00. This follows services disruptions on Monday when municipal management was in a meeting with labour delegations. Services were disrupted for hours and workers eventually resumed their duties.
