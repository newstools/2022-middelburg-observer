The visit, however, didn’t cost local taxpayers a cent, despite the municipality’s involvement in the weeks’ long preparation ahead of the event, which involved the beautification around Kees Taljaard Stadium, including the trimming of trees and maintenance of roads. Interestingly, the municipality recommended that the Freedom Day celebrations take place in the public open space next to the municipal buildings.
The venue was, however, determined unsuitable by President Ramaphosa’s security detail due to the 21-gun salute. A decision was made to utilise the stadium instead, due to its isolation from high rise buildings and residential areas. According to municipal spokeswoman Ms Prudence Magutle, the municipality was involved with logistical issues like providing venues for the celebrations and accreditation purposes, which were done at the banquet hall. Apart from the SAPS, the municipal law enforcement department was also involved in determining safe routes for the presidential convoy, which included vehicles of ministers and international ambassadors. Ms Magutle says that apart from the event not costing ratepayers a cent, the town also did not benefit financially from the event. “As a partner, we simply supplied the venues and auxiliary services, like standby law enforcement units,” Ms Magutle says. Despite owning the stadium, the municipality had to follow procedure and book the stadium and banquet halls well ahead of the presidential visit.
The presidency and provincial government got first dibs on guests, though the municipality was given a baseline number of available seats to fill. The national and provincial governments were responsible for all costs related to the event, like the marquee tents, seating, stages and food, which was supplied to VIPs, like councillors, in takeaway bags. The cost revelation was made during last week’s ordinary council sitting, in which the DA’s Odwa Thabatha asked for a breakdown of costs.
