Luckily, when the tow bar of the trailer broke, and the trailer ran away, no cars were behind it. Van Wettens initially indicated that the recovery would necessitate the closure of Meyer Street. The team, however, succeeded in carrying out the tricky salvaging operation from the side of the historic unused bridge. Van Wettens told www.mobserver.co.za on the scene that the closure of roads, especially during peak hours, is always the last resort. The trailer was towed from the river bank, up a steep incline, without any significant damage to either the trailer or its fragile cargo.
Most of the doorframes could be salvaged, with only a handful damaged during the accident.
