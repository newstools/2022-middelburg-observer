The pair were attacked and tortured on their Marchlands farm near Dullstroom in 2017. Ms Howarth was shot while sleeping in bed. Her body was later thrown into the back of their bakkie and discarded next to a rural road, where Mr Lynn succeeded in flagging down a car after he was ordered to kneel and a shot was fired at his head. He miraculously survived the barbaric ordeal after being tortured with a blowtorch for hours. Ms Howarth’s close friend Claire Taylor, who has been present for all the court proceedings during the past couple of years, welcomed the sentences. Upon leaving the court, she notified Mr Lynn, who has since relocated back to the UK. The following sentences were handed down: Nkosinathi Yika: • Count 1 – housebreaking – 15 years direct imprisonment.
• Count 4 – discharging of a firearm in a built-up area – five years direct imprisonment.
• Count 5 – murder – 20 years direct imprisonment.
• Count 6 – attempted murder – 12 years direct imprisonment.
• Count 7 – theft – five years direct imprisonment.
• Count 8 – kidnapping – five years direct imprisonment.
• Count 9 – kidnapping – five years direct imprisonment. The sentences for housebreaking, discharging of a firearm, and theft, will run concurrent with the 20-year murder sentence, while both kidnapping sentences will also be served concurrently. Themba William Yika: • Count 1 – housebreaking – 15 years direct imprisonment.
