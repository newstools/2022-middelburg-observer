The Rock Of Miracles place of safety needs nappies and wet wipes for the foster children in their care. The centre, which currently takes care of three teenagers and three infants, is pleading with the public to help them achieve its target of 500 packs of nappies before July 18. This target will be their year-long supply for the children in their care. Any donations of nappies or wet wipes can be dropped off at the following places: • HTS Middelburg’s marketing office
• Kudusrust Biltong Deli
• Amora Dierepark
• The Middelburg Observer editorial office. If you would rather donate your time as a volunteer, contact Lu-Anne Dippenaar on 082 602 5139.
