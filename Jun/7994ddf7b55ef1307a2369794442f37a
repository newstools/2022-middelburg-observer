A fed-up resident, Mr David Maqhajana, turned to www.mobserver.co.za after five attempts to visit the department proved fruitless due to closure. David, who lives in Doornkop, explained how he leaves the warmth of his home at 04:00 in the morning just to find a reasonable spot in the already winding queue. David, who is unemployed, has attempted five times since last week to visit the department to claim for UIF. As an unemployed citizen, he’s had to spend money he does not have for transport to and from Doornkop, just to be met with closed doors. “Some people already queue from 03:00 in the morning,” he said. According to David, the office only operates for a certain number of hours each day, and waiting residents were told that the office closure is due to ongoing water interruptions. He added that on one occasion he was tenth in line when they were all ushered out by staff members, who informed them the office needed to close. The manager of the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality’s communications department, Ms Prudence Magutle, told www.mobserver.co.za that they are unaware of the closure and the water interruptions do not validate the closure of the labour department. She further added that STLM is also affected by the water interruptions, yet they continue to remain open for services. “Any state entity that is affected by water interruptions should firstly report it to our Department of Water and Sanitation, so that the water supply can be restored or alternatively, so that water provisions can be made. But under no circumstances should they close or change trading hours.” Residents who visit the labour department are urged to report any closures to the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality. Www.mobserver.co.za attempted to verify the closure of the Department of Labour, but they could not be reached telephonically before time of publication.
