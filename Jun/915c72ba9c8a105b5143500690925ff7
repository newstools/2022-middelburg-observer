The primary guardian, Ms Lu-Anne Dippenaar, cares for six children alone while her husband works to keep the pots boiling. The Rock of Miracles is a registered non-profit organisation whose children get referred to them by the CMR. Lu-Anne currently takes care of an 18-year-old boy, 15-year-old girl, 12-year-old girl, two-year-old boy, six-month-old girl and one-month-old boy. The safe haven desperately needs donations of nappies and wet wipes and has a target of acquiring 2 000 packets of nappies by Mandela Day (July 18). The following drop-off points are available for donations:
• HTS Middelburg marketing office
• Amora Animal Park
• Kudusrust Biltong Deli
• The Middelburg Observer editorial office Should you not be able to assist financially, you can volunteer your time by helping with the care of the children. Contact Lu-Anne Dippenaar on 082 602 5139.
