He is a rugby fullback and grade 11 pupil at Hoërskool Middelburg. The 18-year-old’s rugby career started when he was in grade 1. Philasande enjoys being on the field because of the brotherhood that comes with rugby. When he is not playing rugby, he enjoys running on the track. His favourite player is Mfundo Ndhlovu because he is one of the best, has a positive attitude and is always willing to teach. When asked about his plans after school, Philasande said he wants to pursue sports professionally and hopefully emigrate overseas to grow his career.
