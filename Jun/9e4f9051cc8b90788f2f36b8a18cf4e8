DA Ward Councillor, Hennie Niemann, has confirmed the closure and warned that a possible fourth strike is on the cards. • It has been reliably learned that the interruption of municipal services follows on the demands of municipal employees that charges laid against some employees be withdrawn. Municipal workers are also disgruntled with the upgrade of municipal security and striking workers allegedly feel unsafe with the new security. Residents are advised to avoid the municipal buildings.
