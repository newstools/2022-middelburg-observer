Angry residents descended from the stadium to where the raffle was taking place and interrupted the proceedings. According to community members, municipal officials withdrew 279 numbers belonging to first-time buyers and as they were about to start the raffle for homeowners wanting to buy stands, the first time buyers questioned the process. Community members went to the podium to question the officials. They wanted to see how many numbers were left in the first time buyer’s box.
Residents said they were surprised to find “that the box was empty”. They suspect that their numbers were never put in the box and that municipal officials duped the process. Municipal spokesperson, Ms Prudence Magutle, said the municipality is trying to establish what led to the disruption and that the proceeding are suspended till further notice. A new sale date will be communicated to successful candidates.
