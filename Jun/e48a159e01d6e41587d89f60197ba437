The case was supposed to be heard in the Middelburg Magistrates’ Court today, however, Mr Sammy Miyambu withdrew the matter.
Scores of municipal workers, including traffic officials, went to the court in solidarity of the accused workers. Residents raised concern about workers abandoning their duties to attend the court case.
Last week Friday, workers halted services at the traffic department over disputes with management. Since last September’s municipal strike, the town has been on a verge of a collapse, with services being randomly suspended leaving residents to bear the brunt.
