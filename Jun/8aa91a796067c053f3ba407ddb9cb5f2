A widely circulated letter by municipal workers warned senior officials to stay at home on Monday, “Workers are cautioning all progressive Managers and Directors to sit at home because all the workers will be at the Civic Centre to prevent both the Mayor and the illegal acting Manager to enter the building and the body guards are advised not to drive the Mayor in that building (sic).” The letter also said if the municipality doesn’t withdraw suspension letters for suspended workers, service delivery will be halted. When www.mobserver.co.za visited the civic centre today (Monday), services were operational, and the licensing department was also open to the public.
