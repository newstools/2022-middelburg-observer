The sale of stands was suspended after first time buyers accused the municipality of “rigging the raffle sale”. The municipality decided to restart the process. Buyers who have already paid for the stands are requested to go to the municipality with an affidavit and proof of payment. An investigation will also be conducted to establish what led to the disruptions on Wednesday. “Once the investigation is finalised legal action will be taken against those that are involved in the illegal selling and buying of municipal stands based on the evidence provided,” acting municipal manager, Ms Thokozile Zulu, said in a press statement. In the meantime, the municipality said it will refund those who have already paid for stands, re-advertise the selling of stands, and announce a new date for the sale. The acting municipal manager also warned municipal workers and residents against illegal selling and buying of stands.
