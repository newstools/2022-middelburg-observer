Solid waste workers reported for duty at the solid waste workshop on Protea Street this morning and are currently collecting rubbish per the municipal schedule.
Services at the civic centre have also resumed. This comes after top ANC officials held a meeting with the local caucus on Tuesday. Municipal employees refused to return to work due to an upgrade in security, and workers claimed they felt unsafe. The municipality has withdrawn armed security guards. Workers say that if they find security personnel carrying firearms on municipal premises, they will stop working again. Disputes flared up last Friday after workers downed tools to gather at court, where assault charges against some employees were withdrawn.
