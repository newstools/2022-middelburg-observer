Having been described as an “attention glutton” by his own brother, Ronnie, in court, Knoesen’s warning to his family about global recognition was the only truth that came from his mouth during the marathon treason trial. Knoesen was found guilty on three terrorism charges on Monday, for which he faces three mandatory life sentences. He pleaded guilty to the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition at the start of the trial, which could add another 20-years to his sentence.
The trial has entered its penalty phase, with Knoesen requesting a psychological evaluation ahead of sentencing. Www.observer.co.za was the only media present throughout the trial, with the Associated Press (AP) and Media24 attending Monday’s judgement.
AP’s report, however, was scooped up by media from New Zealand to Las Vegas. Knoesen would be impressed with the coverage he received from the ultra-conservative Fox-news network. The tsunami of coverage on his conviction includes the Washington Post, Huffpost, ABC News, The Philadelphia Tribute, San Francisco Chronicle, Detroit Patriot, Yahoo.com, the Pulitzer prize laureate Star Tribune, the Las Vegas Sun, Toronto Star and various UK publications like the Independent, among other notable outlets. Knoesen also received prominent airtime on Dr Rashad Richey’s YouTube platform with 399 000 subscribers and 163 000 views already. Dr Richey, an Emmy nominated political analyst for CBS News, said in the eight-minute clip that the US government, currently dealing with the January 6 insurrection hearings, “we should recruit South African intelligence to come and work for the Department of Justice in America”. Dr Richey is also a frequent commentator on MSNBC, CNBC, BBC, The Young Turks Network and the Fox News Channel. See the clip here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w_kvNUIiqM.
