Dashcam footage that was made available by PG Roos Transport, shows how the bakkie veered into the oncoming lane before the two vehicles collided, setting the bakkie alight. The collision occurred yesterday afternoon, about 25 km outside of Middelburg. According to Mr Petrus Roos, the driver of his truck was fortunate to sustain minor injuries after the truck overturned.
The driver of the bakkie managed to escape the blaze and survived the collision. Mr Roos said that the collision caused an estimated R3 million in damages. He added that the video will hopefully put an end to the speculations circulating on social media. “This collision played out almost exactly the same way as the accident in December near the Middelburg airfield, which also involved one of my trucks. We have lost three trucks in the last two years on the Loskop road, all of them within a 20 km range from Middelburg.” Mr Roos added that there is a dire need for law enforcement on the busy route, where drivers generally disregard the rules of the road.
He concluded that he is grateful his driver wasn’t to seriously injured. • The expertise of Mr Louwtjie Swart from Van Wettens Towing Services, was called in to assist in the truck recovery.
