The wires have been causing sparks, and residents fear a fire may be caused, or someone could get hurt. Andy Anderson told www.mobserver.co.za that in February he was without power for five days due to an electrical fault caused by the lamp post.
He reported the matter to the municipality and councillors, however, the matter was never attended to. He contacted a private contractor and paid R3 000 of his own money to restore the power. This is not the first time residents have had to fork out money to repair electrical faults. Businessmen in the industrial area had to pay thousands of rands from their own pockets to restore damaged and stolen electrical cables during several illegal municipal strikes. The municipality told www.mobserver.co.za that it would dispatch a team to the scene.
