The driver of a company bakkie drove through a wall damaging three office containers and a precast wall.
The containers had computers and important documents dating back to 2009. Fortunately, the people inside the house were not injured.  The driver of the bakkie was found unconscious in the vehicle and was transported to the hospital for medical treatment. This is not the first time the wall, which is located near a cul-de-sac, has been damaged. Two weeks ago, the property owners installed a visible precast wall in an effort to prevent motorists from driving through their property.
