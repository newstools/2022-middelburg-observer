Mr Anthony Boucher (head investigator) said they were appointed by Highveld Toilet Hire to investigate the theft of 12 portable toilets. “Our client was contacted by two individuals and introduced themselves as Peet van Wyk and Nick van Niekerk. They claimed to be from a company named Agrico. They completed paperwork for the rental of the toilets, filling in all the company details, including banking and registration information correctly, they only changed the contact number and email address to their own.” According to Mr Boucher, the two men sent a fake proof of payment to cover the deposit amount once the paperwork was completed, “Our client only realised that the payment was fake after the toilets were delivered.” On May 26, the last of the toilets were out for delivery when the men contacted Highveld Toilet Hire, claiming there was a problem on the site where the units were due to be delivered. They then arranged for the units to be transferred from the delivery vehicle to their own at a local gas station. They discovered later that the payments were fake and tried to contact the suspects, but no contact has been made since. “By further investigation, it was established that the vehicle used by the suspects during the delivery was a rented vehicle. The official Agrico company was able to confirm that the two men were not employed by the company or in any way involved with the company.” Mr Boucher said that investigations are still ongoing, “Judging from what we have found, the men left little to no paper trail, making us believe they have done this before.” If anyone has more information, contact SA Investigations on 064 534 5853 or email anthony@rsainvestigate.com.
