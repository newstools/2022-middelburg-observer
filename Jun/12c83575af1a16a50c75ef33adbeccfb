DA Ward Councillor, Morgan Bruiners, confirmed that the foetus was discovered early this morning on an illegal dumping site on the corner of Montego and Petersen Street. Cllr. Bruiners expressed his disappointment at the tragic discovery, saying that its the first time a baby or foetus was found abandoned in their community. He further condemned acts of illegal dumping, adding that it enables the inappropriate disposal of harmful waste. The SAPS were dispatched, who in turn alerted medical personnel and the forensic department to take charge of the foetus.
