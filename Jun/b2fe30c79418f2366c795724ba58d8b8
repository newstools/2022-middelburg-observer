Ratepayers have been visiting the department for the last few days and going back home empty-handed. They were told that the system was offline on Thursday when in fact the workers were gathered at the Middelburg Magistrates Court. This comes after the deputy director of the licensing department opened assault charges against some of his colleagues during previous labour unrest. On Friday residents were told that workers downed tools because they feel “unsafe” due to security personnel carrying firearms. • Last week Friday, workers halted services at the traffic department over a dispute with management.
