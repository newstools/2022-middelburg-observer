The proceedings started at 08:00 today. Although there were threats of disruptions, nothing out of order occurred so far. At least 7 000 people are attending the raffle sale for the 700 stands. Police and municipal law enforcement agencies are at the event. A total of 40 per cent of the stands are reserved for previously disadvantaged communities, namely the Black, Coloured and Indian communities and 50 per cent of the stands will be discounted at market value to first-time buyers. The new development will have a school, several churches and other amenities.
