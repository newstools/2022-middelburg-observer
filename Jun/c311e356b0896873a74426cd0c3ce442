Da Ward Councillor, Deon van der Merwe, told www.mobserver.co.za that on top of the estimated 16 pipe bursts over the weekend, the municipality had to tend to Monday’s ruptures in Verdoorn, Kwarts, Koper, Erembee and Steelpoort Streets as well. Cllr van der Merwe explained that while the DA intends on pulsing the council about addressing the alarming and overwhelming number of pipe bursts in a committee meeting on Friday, he attended a visit of the aged asbestos pipe system in the area with Executive Mayor Mhlonishwa Masilela, over the weekend, who promised to issue a detailed report on the subject. While the report has not yet been received, Acting Municipal Manager Ms Thokozile Zulu issued a statement informing residents that the increased pipe bursts are owed to the aged asbestos pipe network and that low temperatures due to winter play a contributing factor in the pipe bursts. The statement also added that the municipality has implemented the pipe replacement programme, which involves the cutover from the old asbestos pipes to the new PVC system, and that some streets in the affected areas have already been switched over. The Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, however, has dedicated a team to conduct pressure testing in the affected areas, which has taken place as of Monday.
Once the testing is complete, the municipality will commence with the cutover. In the meantime, residents have been making use of water provisions through means of water tankers. A Middelburg Help Mekaar WhatsApp group has also been created for volunteers within the community to open their households for affected residents by offering washing machines and ablutions to desperate families.
