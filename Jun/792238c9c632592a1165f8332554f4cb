For the last five years, Cllr Bruiners has been assisting pensioners with their municipal pension rebates, this is the discount pensioners receive on their rates, sewer and refuse tariffs. Cllr. Bruiners uses his own petrol to collect forms from the municipal civic centre, he then assists pensioners to complete the forms and then goes on behalf of the pensioners to the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) offices, before submitting the forms at the civic centre. He aids over 80 pensioners and has urged other councillors to assist pensioners in their wards. Those interested in renewing their rebates should do so before June 30. Pensioners who miss the deadline may still apply, however, the rebate will only be granted as of the date of application. Cllr. Bruiners thanked SASSA officials for their excellent service.
