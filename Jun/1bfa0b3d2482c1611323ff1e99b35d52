The effort was spearheaded by Community Safety Mayoral Committee Member Ms Bathobile Shabangu. Ms Shabangu sprang into action after appeals from DA councillor Damien Klopper, who says that he’s been inundated by complaints from Rietkuil residents about a spike in crime due to the illegal sale of alcohol. Warnings were issued to a number of businesses during an initial inspection last week.  Yesterday, the municipality pounced on illegal businesses again. This time, however, the municipality joined hands with home affairs, law enforcement agencies and local health inspectors, resulting in a number of businesses being shut, like Rietkuil Liquors, whose trade permit had expired. Affected businesses were guided on how to renew permits and licences because the aim of the blitz was not to close down businesses, but rather to enforce compliance with legislation and by-laws.  Even a diesel tank on private property was confiscated for the illegal sale of fuel.
Other confiscated items included large quantities of alcohol, illicit cigarettes and expired foodstuffs. Cllr Klopper lauded Ms Shabangu for the effort, “It’s important to note that businesses and people weren’t specifically targeted, but the law is the law and everyone needs to comply,” Mr Klopper told www.mobserver.co.za. Cllr Klopper says he’s also available to assist affected businesses with obtaining permits and licences to stimulate the economy and create more jobs “legally and above board”.
