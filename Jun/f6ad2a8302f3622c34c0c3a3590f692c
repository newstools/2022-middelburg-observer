The driver of a Fortuner that ploughed into a stationary truck, was lucky to escape with only slight injuries. The truck made an illegal U-turn but misjudged the space available.
The truck got stuck, blocking the road, resulting in the collision. Traffic is flowing but very slowly, with vehicles having to manoeuvre around the truck on the shoulder of the road.
The collision occurred close to the N4 slipway. • Motorists should also be careful on the N4 between Wonderfontein and the Alzu rest stop, where a taxi rolled a short while ago.
Emergency services are on the scene.
