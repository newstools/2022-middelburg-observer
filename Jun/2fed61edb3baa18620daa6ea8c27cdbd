The man in the passenger seat jumped out and instructed the girl to “give me the cell phone or I’ll shoot you,” as he proceeded to stick his hand into his jacket. The girl, who had a friend nearby, started running towards another vehicle where she was helped. Despite both incidents reportedly taking place at the same time, the mother is convinced that it is the same vehicle and suspects, because both are identical in description.

She also explained that her daughter was afraid of abduction because of the way the man charged at her. “We need to spread the news as far as possible, because evidently these men are actively scouting the community.”
