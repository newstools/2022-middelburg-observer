Loyal patrons can not only look forward to a brand new and state of the art filling station, but some give-aways as well! A R1000 fuel voucher is up for grabs in a lucky draw that will be running until next week Friday, where one lucky reader will be drawn. To enter, readers need to fill out the competition entry form available in this week’s Middelburg Observer and drop it into the box at Kanonkop Filling Station’s kiosk. Patrons of Kanonkop Filling Station will also receive a free copy of the Middelburg Observer, where 100 newspapers will be handed out free of charge for today (Friday) only! Pay a visit to the brand new Kanonkop Engel Filling Station on 28 Sering Street for friendly and efficient service, 24/7!
