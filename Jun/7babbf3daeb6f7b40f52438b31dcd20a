According to Louwtjie Swart of Van Wettens, the white Volvo truck experienced a tire burst before swerving into the oncoming lane.
The two trucks collided resulting in one rolling and losing its cargo.  Emergency services are also on the scene. Motorists must proceed with caution as the entire scene is littered with corn, making the road surface extra slippery. One of the drivers was injured and taken to hospital. The driver of the other truck escaped unharmed.
