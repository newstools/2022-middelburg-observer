Residents were desperately trying to purchase electricity only to find the tokens they had purchased could not be loaded. According to an SMS sent by the municipality, token holders will receive their tokens’ worth of electricity today. Prepaid24 responded to electricity purchases online with a generic message, saying the matter had been escalated to the municipality, which had run out of credit. Councillors received countless complaints, which have all been forwarded to the municipality.
The municipality could, however, not tend to the matter before the start of business today. The DA’s Johann Dyason says 24-hour vendors were also affected. Residents should also note that all prepaid electricity vendors will be offline from 12:00 on June 30.
Prepaid sales will resume on July 1. The pay points, including Prepaid24, will be offline due to the financial year-end. Municipal tariff increases will also be implemented on July 1.
