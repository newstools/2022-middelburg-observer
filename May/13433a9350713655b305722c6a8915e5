Kgosi Makwati, the main instigator of the recent spate of municipal labour strikes have been served with suspension letters after a volatile week of unrest. Municipal management have been locked in meetings with the department of cooperative governance all day to try and avert another strike. Makwati has been suspended with full pay pending investigations on his alleged failure to conduct himself with honesty and integrity, in that he has deliberately distorted Acting Municipal Manager, Ms Thokozile Zulu’s written response to employee grievances, resulting in a disruption of municipal services yet again. He is also charged with “rude, aggressive and insolent conduct towards Ms Zulu on May 12, when a number of municipal employees disrupted a public service delivery meeting in council chambers, further resulting in Ms Zulu being doused with water. Makwati has 48-hours to respond to the suspension. A decision on Makwati’s permanent suspension will be communicated to in five days after his submissions.
