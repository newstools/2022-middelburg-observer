Employees have, however, raised a number of issues they say need to be addressed, in order to settle the ongoing labour dispute. Employees gathered at the municipality on Friday, where issues, such as ringfencing 100 stands for municipal workers at the Dennesig North housing development, were raised. Employees will be compiling a comprehensive report on their demands, but all have decided to bury the hatchet with the municipality for now.
Employees returned to their duties immediately after Friday’s meeting. Municipal spokeswoman, Ms Prudence Magutle, told www.mobserver.co.za that all municipal services are being rendered, including the licence department.
