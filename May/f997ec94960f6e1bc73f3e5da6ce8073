“I should have done something,” he conceded on the hard-line of questions concerning his oblivious attitude towards his throngs of warmongering supporters, who may have acted on his calls for genocide especially after his arrest. Knoesen said he never thought anyone would act on his “impossible” calls for a government coup. Shortly after the emotional breakdown, prosecutor Derik Rowles concluded the cross-examination by putting the state’s case to him chronologically, soliciting short and clear denials for Knoesen, who is facing three mandatory life sentences on top of the 15-year and five year prison sentences for the possession of an unlicensed Baby Browning and ammunition, to which he pleaded guilty to earlier in the trial. Knoesen again today changed tune on the defense witnesses he wants to call, saying that his brother Ronnie should also be added to the list alongside “two or three family members,” Knoesen plans to call as character witnesses. Two high-ranking Hawks officials will also be subpoenaed for Knoesen’s defense with the assistance of the state. The trial is set to continue tomorrow with testimony from one of the Hawks Colonels.
The other has to travel from KZN, while Knoesen’s brother Ronnie has to be transferred from the Cape. Knoesen profusely apologized to the court for his muddled defense and promised “to do better”.
