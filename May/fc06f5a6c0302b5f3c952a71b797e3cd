A large group of municipal workers have halted services and gathered at the civic centre.
The “meeting” has caused concern among residents over a possible flare-up in strike action. The crowd has blocked off the entrance to the Civic Centre and municipal trucks, including garbage trucks, are lining Wanderers Avenue. An employee told www.mobserver.co.za that workers are discussing wages they were supposed to receive last month.
It is not clear whether the workers are going to resume services after the meeting. The police are currently at the scene, in the meantime residents are advised to stay clear of Wanderers Avenue.
