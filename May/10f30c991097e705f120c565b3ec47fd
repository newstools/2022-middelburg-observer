The man, a Middelburg resident, who requested to stay anonymous, is an employee at Instrolec and was attacked at the entrance to the power station. The protest action flared up two weeks ago, and residents of a nearby settlement are disgruntled with a company contracted by Duvha, for employing people who are not from the local area. During the previous protest, the man was allowed through by strikers after he informed them which company he works for. Today, however, he was unaware of the protest action and was accosted as he approached one of Duvha’s entrances. Some of the strikers aggressively told him to leave the premises but before he could do so, strikers assaulted him through his open window, as well as damaged his vehicle. He wishes to warn members of the public to avoid the area. According to the man, only the entrances to Duvha Power Station are currently being affected by the strike. The SAPS are at the scene.
