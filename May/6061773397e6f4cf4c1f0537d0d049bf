Vusi Maphanga made a brief court appearance on Wednesday. He was arrested three weeks ago following the death of Ms Thato Mathati (23). Mr Maphanga abandoned his bail application.
The matter will sit in the Middelburg Magistrates’ Court on May 26. Members of the EFF picketed outside the court in solidarity with the family of Ms Mathati. Mr Maphanga was arrested after the police were dispatched to the Middelburg Provincial Hospital on April 15 to open a murder docket after the victim died at the hospital. The victim had bruises on her face, but it’s unclear what led to her death.
