In both instances Knoesen indicated that he wasn’t feeling well. When the trial resumed today, the court struggled with some technical recording problems, resulting in the matter only being called after 11:00.
Knoesen again asked for a postponement until Friday, but Judge Johanna Mthimunye will recall the matter on Wednesday. Knoesen, who chose to defend himself, earlier indicated that he wasn’t planning on calling any defense witnesses, but today he also changed tune, telling court that indeed plan to call his brother, Ronnie, among other witnesses. The state has closed its case.
