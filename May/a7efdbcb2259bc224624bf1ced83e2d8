The alert warns motorists that hijackers now make use of a new method to bring vehicles to a standstill, through the use of an iron rod.
It further states that a man walks into the middle of the highway and hurls the rod like a spear towards oncoming cars. It also stated that an incident took place roughly 10 km from the Diamond Hill Toll Plaza on the N4 and that it was reported to the SAPS and TRAC. Ms Soares told the Middelburg Observer that TRAC is aware of the alert making the rounds, but no incident of the kind had ever been reported to the TRAC help desk. “We cannot confirm or deny whether the incident took place and the alert does not specify when the incident allegedly took place. TRAC cannot investigate such claims if no report was appropriately filed.”
