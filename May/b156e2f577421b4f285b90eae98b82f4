The service delivery protest started at about 06:00 today (Thursday). Residents in Mhluzi and other parts of Middelburg have been without electricity and water for almost a week.
Residents have to bear the brunt of the illegal municipal strike.  Workers downed tools last week Thursday leaving residents without services.
It is unclear when the power will be restored, due to the ongoing illegal strike. The strike follows after some employees were unhappy after the job grading against Nkomazi Municipality did not benefit them financially.
Workers are now demanding that the money earmarked for 24-months’ worth of back pay be divided equally among workers.
