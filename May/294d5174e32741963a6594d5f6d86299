The need for help and support increases dramatically every day, with more families being hungry and not having adequate clothing or shelter. This winter there will, as in the past, be a need for blankets and the less privileged are already visiting the offices of welfare organisations, including the Middelburg CMR office, to ask for a blanket to fight away the cold. They aim to have at least 500 blankets to hand out to the needy this winter.
“We need your support to reach this goal!” Blankets can be dropped off at 23A Plein Street or donations can be made towards the project. For more information, call the CMR at 013 282 7261. • Amy Gwebu, Middelburg’s own Little Miss City Council and Little Miss Coalfields 2022, decided to help Middelburg CMR with their project by collecting blankets. She is prepared to collect blankets with the help of her mother. Contact Yvonne at 072 404 5122. • Article 18A receipts will be available upon request from the CMR to businesses and private persons. CMR Middelburg is a registered NPO and complies with all the conditions, which entitles donors to a: TAX exemption receipt in terms of section 18A of the TAX ACT and a BEE point certificate to score SED (Socio-Economic Development, Code 700) points on donors’ BB-BEE scorecards (Reference Giving Warmth Blanket Project).
