A fuming resident who lives in Limpopo Street, Groenkol, said their electricity cables were stolen last Tuesday.
Since then, residents have made numerous calls to the municipality, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. On Monday evening, Extension 8 residents burnt tyres in an effort to have their pleas heard. Residents said after the mayor addressed them, their electricity was restored three hours later. In the meantime, other parts of the municipality are still without power. It is unclear when the power will be restored, due to the ongoing illegal municipal strike that started last Thursday. Some employees are unhappy after the job grading against Nkomazi Municipality did not benefit them financially. Workers are now demanding that the money earmarked for 24-months’ worth of back pay be divided equally among workers. On Monday, the Acting Municipal Manager, Ms Thokozile Zulu, announced that a ‘no work, no pay’ policy be implemented, she also ordered all workers to return to work.
