Municipal employees will meet with management today to discuss hundreds of appeals lodged against the implementation of the new salary increments, following the salary and job-grade benchmarking against Nkomazi Municipality late last year. Employees themselves chose Nkomazi Municipality for the evaluation. Following the process, employees realised that the exercise benefitted only a small number of employees financially.
Many received no upward adjustments, while the bulk only benefitted minimally. The municipality established a five-member conflict resolution committee, headed by the provincial Department of Cooperative Governance, which is also involved with further negotiations between the authority and 1 500 personnel. Since last week, the committee has been bogged down with appeal deliberations, the outcome of which will be communicated to municipal employees today. Scores of employees have started gathering at the municipal magasyn, awaiting the appeals report.
Employees may embark on a fourth strike, depending on the outcome.
