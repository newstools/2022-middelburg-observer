He followed them and found cutting tools in the boot of the maroon VW vehicle driven by the saboteurs.
The cables were cut on the corner of Luttig- and Zuid Street. The man quickly took photos of the cutting tools and vehicle when the two vandals disappeared around a corner to cut more electrical cables. He says he believes that it was sabotage due to the expensive car the men were driving.
“Its clear they are not in need of money,” the source said. He said it was the second time that he saw the same men cutting cables, but that he could not follow them the previous time as he had his children in his vehicle. This time, however, he followed them and provided the proof to www.mobserver.co.za.
