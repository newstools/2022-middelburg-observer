Workers resumed their duties on Saturday, however, piles of rubbish remain on the side of pavements. Outsourced workers have been spotted collecting rubbish in black bags and neatly putting it on the side of the road for municipal workers to collect with a refuse truck. Sadly, rubbish in Dr Beyers Naudé Street was not collected. This has caused frustration among residents.  Some residents told www.mobserver.co.za that informal recyclers scavenge through the plastic bags and leave the waste exposed. Municipal spokesperson, Ms Prudence Magutle, said there is a backlog due to the recent strike. She also added that the municipality is currently following its usual schedule and that it will attend to the complaints.
